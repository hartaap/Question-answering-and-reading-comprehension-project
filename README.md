# Question-answering-and-reading-comprehension-project
Question answering and reading comprehension project on the eHoVy RACE reading-comprehension dataset from Hugging Face. In this project, we train and compare a variety of deep learning models, especially large language models, to obtain information on smaller scale models and their generalization ability.
